                        <p>My favorite hobby of mine is track riding. More specifically on sport 
                            motorcycles. My favorite track is Sonoma Raceway, and I try to go to 
                            as many track days as I can and have time for. I ride a 2008 Yamaha 
                            R6 which is modified by me for racing. I am not the fastest on the 
                            track, but it is my dream to get faster, and I practice almost every 
                            single day. The races I participate in are not televised, and wouldn't 
                            really be characterized as races, but the goal is to improve your lap 
                            times and get better so maybe one day you can race in front of a 
                            television audience. I do love me some adrenaline, and that is why I 
                            love to ride sport bikes so much. You can see my gear and bike in the 
                            attached images.

                        <p>The cute little bunny in the images is my bunny. He is the cutest thing ever 
                            and I love him so much. His name is BunBun, and he is a Rex/Lionhead bunny. 
                            He is a male and is about a year and a half old at the time of the creation 
                            of this website.
